# go-avalon 

go-avalon is a `gophserjs` binding of [avalon.js][], which is a MVVM javascript framework like `Angular.js`, but more simpler yet powerful.

This binding aims to provide a better `avalon.js` API than JavaScript itself (from the Go point of view).

## Finished Bindings

1. avalon.js API
2. avalon.js element API
3. ViewModel with a clear API in GO
4. [mmRequest](https://github.com/Archs/go-avalon/tree/master/mmRequest), ajax requesting support
