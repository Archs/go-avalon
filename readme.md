# go-avalon 

go-avalon is a `gophserjs` binding of [avalon.js][], which is a MVVM javascript framework like `Angular.js`, but more simpler yet powerful.

## Finished Bindings

1. avalon.js API
2. avalon.js element API
3. ViewModel with a clear API in GO
4. mmRequest, ajax requesting support

## TODO

1. mmRoute bindings, for in page URL routing 
2. mmAnimate bindings??, an animation library 

## Attention 

This binding aims to provide a better `avalon.js` API than JavaScript itself (from the Go point of view).

This library is not well tested yet, if you hava problems using it, please
let me know. :)
